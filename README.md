In this Java class I created a function 'secret()' that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. This class will determines if the secret() function is additive [secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y)], for all combinations x and y, where x and y are all prime numbers less than the number passed via the command-line argument to the class.


It is very easy to run this program, just pass an integer greater than 2 and less than Max_Value of Integer, then the list of all integers less than the integer passed via command-line argument are printed and determines whether the secret function is additive or not for the passed integer value.

If the integer passed via command-line argument is null or less than 3 or not an integer or greater than Max_value of integer then you will notified that the integer value passed is of not proper format.
